Hello Everyone, My name is Siddhi Mittal, student of Portland State University and currently doing my graduation in Computer Science.
This is my first time, I got an opportunity to make a portfolio which would really helpful while filling job applications.

During creation of my portfolio, I took refrences from the senior's links presented in final project document
to understand the basic structure, how to present the information and flow of instructions.
Along with that I also refered google searched links, Youtube videos, github, stackOverflow , Bootstrap main website and my previous completed homeworks.

Please find the below referred links that i used while preparing my portfolio website:
